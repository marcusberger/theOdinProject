    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><Strong>Meat:</Strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><Strong>Onion:</Strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><Strong>Canned tomatoes:</Strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><Strong>Fresh herbs:</Strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><Strong>Sugar:</Strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><Strong>Spices and seasonings:</Strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><Strong>Noodles:</Strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><Strong>Cheese:</Strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><Strong>Eggs:</Strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</li>
        <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
