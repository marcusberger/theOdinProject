    <p>Learn how to bake chicken that's tender, juicy, and perfect every time with this simple, 5-ingredient recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Adding just a bit of chicken broth to those beautiful pan drippings creates a tasty pan sauce that adds extra flavor at the table.</p> 

    

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><Strong>Chicken Breasts:</Strong> Of course, you'll need chicken breasts. This recipe calls for four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li><Strong>Olive Oil:</Strong> Olive oil provides moisture and prevents the chicken breasts from drying out. It also helps the chicken cook more evenly.</li>
        <li><Strong>Salt:</Strong>Use your favorite coarse sea salt for the most delicious results. </li>
        <li><Strong>Creole Seasoning:</Strong>Creole seasoning adds flavor and a bit of welcome heat. </li>
        <li><Strong>Chicken Broth:</Strong> You'll use chicken broth to make an easy pan sauce to pour over the baked chicken.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate. Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
